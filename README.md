# Starting point for a new Node.js Restful Api

## How to use ?

#### Clone the project and install dependencies

```
git clone git@github.com:efichot/Boilerplate-Swiss-knives API
cd API
yarn install
```

#### Development mode

```
yarn start
```

#### Tests mode

```
yarn test
```

Follow the `test/main.spec.js` guidelines to write your own tests.

#### Production mode

```
yarn build
yarn production
```

##### Why ?

This is a simple starter boilerplate to avoid to configure the same things each time you start a new project.

##### How it works ?

All the important files are in the `src` folder. The Express and Mongoose configuration files are in `src/config` folder. Each time you want to add a new route to your Api, you can call your mongoose schema, callback you controller and make the logic from an helper.
Use de `.env` file to store your important informations such as your server port, your mongo password, or maybe an OAuth key...
